% \section{Background And Motivation}
%  The authors designed Panorama, a system for detecting production failures in distributed systems. They leveraged the key insight that \textbf{system observability could be improved by making each component an observer of other components with which it interacts}.  Taking advantage of these first-hand observations, the authors came up with a simple detection algorithm that achieved high detection accuracy. Their evaluation on 15 real-world failures suggested that Panorama were able to detect and localize failures in a fast manner, whereas existing detectors would only detect a fraction of the failures and run much longer. A follow-up work by the same group of researchers received a best paper award at NSDI '20, demonstrating the power of this idea \cite{246326}.
